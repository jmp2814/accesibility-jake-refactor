# Code Refactor Starter Code

*For this project, we had to refactor the code to make the site more accesible. I used semantic HTML elements and consolidated CSS to achieve this.*

---The first thing I did when refactoring the code was to go in and replace as many divs as I could with proper semantic HTML elements.

---I added  nav tags to the nav bar with the links. I added a main tag, which then included article, aside, and section tags throughout the rest of the page.

---I then consolidated as much of the CSS as I could, as many of the elements had the same properties. This allowed the CSS to have quite a bit less code in it.

---I then went in and took out some unecessary parts of the HTML that also had no corresponding CSS.
